1.What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the
last line of the code below?

  if false
    greeting = "hello world"
  end

  greeting

nil. If something is initialized in an if, ruby automatically initializes it as
nil just in case the if doesn't run. I got this wrong before trying to run it in irb, guessing an error would happen.
