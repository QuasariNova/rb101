1.What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the
last line of the code below?

  if false
    greeting = "hello world"
  end

  greeting

nil. If something is initialized in an if, ruby automatically initializes it as
nil just in case the if doesn't run. I got this wrong before trying to run it in irb, guessing an error would happen.

2.What is the result of the last line in the code below?

  greetings = { a: 'hi' }
  informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
  informal_greeting << ' there'

  puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
  puts greetings

----

  {:a=>'hi there'}

We assign a reference to the string in the Hash and then mutate that string, so
the string in the hash is the same string, thus changes.
