1.Every object in Ruby has access to a method called object_id, which returns a
numerical value that uniquely identifies the object. This method can be used to
determine whether two variables are pointing to the same object.

Take a look at the following code and predict the output:

  a = "forty two"
  b = "forty two"
  c = a

  puts a.object_id
  puts b.object_id
  puts c.object_id

----

Strings are mutable, thus there can be multiple copies of the same information
in memory, because if it wasn't, unpredictable side effects could happen. So in
this case, a and c will have the same object_id, while b would have a different
one. Basically a and b hold different objects, that just have the same data.
